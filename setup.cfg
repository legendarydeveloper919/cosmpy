# ignored for now. Should fix and relax over time:
# DAR401: Missing exception(s) in Raises section in docstrings
# D202: 1 blank line required between summary line and description in docstrings
# D205: No blank lines allowed after function docstring in docstrings
# D400: First line should end with a period in docstrings
# D401: First line should be in imperative mood in docstrings
# D403: First word of the first line should be properly capitalized in docstrings

# ignore as too restrictive for our needs:
# E501: https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E501.html (Line too long)
# W503: https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W503.html (Line break)
